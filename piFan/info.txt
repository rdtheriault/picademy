This project uses the SenseHat to measure temp and humidity to trigger a fan connected to another Pi using an ExplorerHat

You need to run the commands in setup.sh to get it all setup, if you are not using a webpage there is no need for the last two commands. 

You will also need to activate secure shell (ssh) on the Pi (Google if needed but it has to do with raspi-config)

piFan.py runs on the Pi with the SenseHat
runFan.py runs on the other Pi(s) running the fan
